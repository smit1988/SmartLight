# SmartLight

Here are some Home Assistant YAMLs.

Here's an ESPHome yaml to a light switch that works even when it's offline.
```

Here's an automation to have a Google Nest say something in French when an ESP8266 is turned on.

And here's a Node-RED flow. This was used for the konami code on the light switches. 
The logic for setting up the light switch code actually worked pretty well. If you look at the debug tab you can see a variable incrementing by one every time you click the next button correctly. When an incorrect button is pressed, the sequence is broken and the variable goes back to zero. The chromecast to play the video is nearly useless. It seems to only be able to play videos from the internet, and only when it is a direct link to the video file itself. So that means no youtube, no google drive, no onedrive, no dropbox. I wasn't able to figure out how to play a local video. My jank solution was to upload a video to every internet storage medium I could find until one was generous enough to provide a direct link to the .mp4. I ended up on a 24 hour file sharing site. I.e. this would only open the video for 24 hours and then the link would break. Hey, good enough for a youtube video.
